# What is specifically in terms of selectors?

When a selector is more specific than another, it's styles take precedence over the less specific selector, even when both selectors match the same element on the page.

# When might I use an id selector?

You want to keep all the styles from element and/or the class names but
when you want to override a few spe cific styles for a single element, but you want to avoid using !important

# What is the box model?
"The Property Analogy"

Content - The house
Padding - The Yard
Border - Fence
Margin - Space between your fence and anything else

It's how the browser knows how big to draw your content and its whitespace on the page.
